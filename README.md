an work in progress, vulkan, modern jvm render engine

## Goals
1. give people an opportunity to learn vulkan.
2. be efficient
3. be "just enough" abstraction

## Progress
Currently im:
1. unfucking the engine internals
2. making it so every object has its own descriptor sets 
3. fixing countless bugs
4. refactors
5. gui system TMTMTMTMT

## Long Term goals
1. use "modern rendering techniques" such as gpu driven rendering (https://vkguide.dev/docs/gpudriven)
2. easy to use both in java and kotlin
3. document everything

P.S: im also working on some portal 2 related stuff with the engine
